# COMP90024_Final_Review
## Don't choose this course
+ Prof. Richard can only talk talk and talk, seems like he cannot operate and show any specific technique. Anyway, "talk is cheap, show me the code."
+ The Professor can only use plenty of ppt pages and just read. The useful technical staffs are all lectured by his PhD students or other lecturers.  
+ The assignment mark is very informal and the marking standard is very vague and not consistent between groups.
